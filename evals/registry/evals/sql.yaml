  description: Eval that scores SQL code from 194 examples in the Spider Text-to-SQL test dataset. The problems are selected by taking the first 10 problems for each database that appears in the test set.
    Yu, Tao, et al. \"Spider; A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Task.\" Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2018, https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d18-1425.
  disclaimer: Problems are solved zero-shot with no prompting other than the schema; performance may improve with training examples, fine tuning, or a different schema format. Evaluation is currently done through model-grading, where SQL code is not actually executed; the model may judge correct SQL to be incorrect, or vice-versa.
