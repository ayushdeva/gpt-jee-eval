The loan closed on April 17, 2007. At the time of the closing, Countrywide improperly failed to inform [the Cocrofts] of the real source of funding for their loan. Plaintiffs also contend that Countrywide violated TILA by failing to inform them that they had three days to rescind the loan and by failing to disclose the total sale price and itemize the amount financed, as well as by failing to make unspecified prepayment disclosures. The Cocrofts claim that Countrywide understated the total finance charges for the loan by more than $5,000. Plaintiffs claim that they learned of Countrywide's misrepresentations in June 2009. They decided to exercise their right under the provisions of TILA to rescind the loan. On July 1, 2009, they mailed notice to that effect to BA, the successor to Countrywide, and to MERS. The Cocrofts do not say what if anything happened as a result of those notices, but on September 29, lawyers working for HSBC contacted them and stated that HSBC was ready to begin foreclosure. HSBC claimed that it was the trustee of a trust that included their loan. The Cocrofts, however, contend that the transfer of their loan into the trust was defective. They sent HSBC's lawyers two cease and desist letters, notifying HSBC that they had rescinded the loan. They allege that after receiving one of the cease and desist letters, HSBC informed them that it had no interest in the loan and that they needed to contact the loan's servicer, Roundpoint Mortgage. Plaintiffs also sent a copy of the rescission documents to BAC, which they identify as the actual servicer of the loan. HSBC brought a foreclosure action in Illinois state court on January 19, 2010.

Defendants cut down the south half of a hedge fence which for many years prior to February, 1915, stood upon the line between the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the east forty) and the southwest quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the west forty). On and prior to February 13, 1866, both of these forty-acre tracts belonged to a man named Teadrow. On February 13, 1866, Teadrow conveyed the west forty to Benjamin Newman, and on February 15, 1866, conveyed the east forty to Oliver P. Rice. When these conveyances were made there was a hedge fence on the north half of the line and a wooden fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. In 1868 Benjamin Newman, the owner of the west forty, removed the wooden fence and set out a hedge fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. Thereafter, during the separate ownership of the tracts, Banjamin Newman trimmed and otherwise cared for the hedge fence on the south half of the line and Rice trimmed and looked after the hedge fence on the north half of the line. In December, 1888, Rice conveyed the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 to Benjamin Newman, the latter thereby becoming the owner of both tracts. Thereafter, during the ownership of both tracts by Benjamin Newman, he required the tenants of the west forty to take care of the south half and the tenants of the east forty to take care of the north half of the hedge fence on the line between the two tracts. On June 22, 1904, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to his daughter, F. Eva Newman, the plaintiff, who has since married J. O. Conklin, a warranty deed, conveying to her two hundred acres of land, including the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16, referred to herein as the east forty, but not including the tract referred to herein as the west forty. This deed contained the provision that 'this deed is not to take effect until after the death of the grantor, Benjamin Newman.' The wife of Benjamin Newman, who is still living, did not join in the conveyance. At the same time plaintiff executed and delivered to her father the following written instrument signed by her: 'Whereas Benjamin Newman has this day conveyed to me certain tracts and parcels of land in Pike county, Illinois, to take effect after his death, I hereby agree to pay the taxes on said land in lieu of all rents that I would otherwise have to pay, (this does not affect any rent that is now due,) and in consideration of my paying said taxes I am to receive all the rents, profits, etc., that may accrue on said land.' When the conveyance was made to plaintiff the tract in controversy known as the east forty was in the possession of Joseph Gifford as tenant and the west forth was in the possession of John B. Newman, a grandson of Benjamin Newman, as tenant of Benjamin Newman. When [the plaitiff's] father delivered the deed of June 22, 1904, he took her upon the east forty and told her and Gifford, the tenant, that he was placing her in full possession of the tract; that she was to receive all the rents and profits from the land and was to keep up the repairs and pay the taxes; that she was to have the south half of the fence on the line between the east forth and the west forty and was to keep up that part of the fence, and that George Newman, his son, to whom he then intended to deed the west forty, should keep up the north half of the fence, and that thereafter plaintiff and her tenants kept the south half of the fence in repair while the tenants in possession of the west forty made repairs to the north half of the fence. During the month of January, 1915, a controversy arose between plaintiff and Defendants regarding the ownership of the hedge fence, each party claiming the south half of the fence. During the month of February, 1915, Defendants, over the protest of plaintiff, cut down the south half of the hedge fence on the line between the east forty and the west forty and erected a wire fence in the place thereof."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

The overflow was to relieve pressure in the sewer system during periods of heavy rainfall; it proved successful in preventing backups into nearby homes. However, when water escaped through the overflow, raw sewage was also discharged into an open ditch that flowed into a neighboring pond. In December 1974, the city of O'Fallon closed the overflow. On January 10, 1975, and on subsequent dates, sewage backed up into the plaintiff's house following heavy rainfall. The January 10 backup was the worst, causing water to accumulate in the plaintiff's finished basement to a height of 25 1/2 inches. The lower level of the plaintiff's modern, ranch-style home contained a family room with fireplace and built-in bookshelves, bedroom, closet, bath and utility room with washer, dryer, furnace and water heater. The walls were watermarked, and the tile floor was damaged, as were the furnishings, appliances and many irreplaceable family items such as family photographs and slides. The lower level of the house was virtually unusable for a year, and the plaintiff had to expend considerable time, effort and money in repairing the floor, repainting the walls, and replacing and removing damaged personalty. The city knew the blocking of the overflow would cause some backup, although they were not aware that it would be as severe as it was. From January until April or May 1975, when the city reopened the overflow, the city attempted to alleviate the pressure in the sewer system by pumping the water from the sewers into open ditches during periods of heavy rain. The defendant used either large or small pumps, depending upon the amount of water in the system.

According to the testimony of the plaintiff, he, the plaintiff, arrived at his home about five o'clock on Friday afternoon, June 19, 1953, from his work as a bricklayer's helper. After he had had his evening meal, he left home about seven o'clock, paid a coal bill to a Mr. Burke, and then he and Burke went to a tavern where they remained an hour and a half, during which time the plaintiff drank two bottles of beer. Mr. Burke went home, and the plaintiff proceeded to another tavern and remained there until after midnight. At the second tavern he had four or five bottles of beer.

When the equipment is maintained, repaired, or 'torn down,' employees of A.C. Equipment oversee the work to ensure it is performed in accordance with standards and specifications. The overseers perform broad and varied duties including 'receiving readings from workers.' In the spring of 1989, A.C. Equipment and Springfield scheduled maintenance on the turbines at Lakeside Two. TGM was contracted to be a labor broker and to hire the workers to perform the repairs on the turbines. Defendants Davis and Fitzgerald were project manager supervisors employed by Springfield, and Bee, also a Springfield employee, was a supervisor in charge of maintenance projects at Lakeside Two. Defendant Alemi was the employee of A.C. Equipment who was overseeing the turbine maintenance project at Lakeside Two. At a pre-job meeting, Davis, Fitzgerald, Bee and Alemi discussed the fact that asbestos insulation was present on and around the turbines, but decided not to have the asbestos professionally removed because that would significantly delay the project. On April 24, 1989, and subsequent thereto, asbestos samplings indicated that significant asbestos was on and around the turbines on which plaintiffs were working. Purchase and repair records maintained at Lakeside Two indicated the types of insulation previously removed during maintenance projects and the types of new insulation used to replace that which had been removed. The defendants [therefore] knew the plaintiffs were working on and around machinery containing significant amounts of asbestos insulation. Plaintiffs' duties involved alignment and maintenance of the turbines. This work was performed in areas where pipes and other structures were insulated with insulation containing significant amounts of asbestos. The insulating material was in a deteriorated condition, causing extensive amounts of dust. Plaintiffs were often coated with white dust and breathed in the white dust, some of which contained asbestos insulation. It was alleged asbestos, a known carcinogen, may cause asbestosis, progressive fibrosis, mesothelioma, cancer of the pleural lining or of the peritoneum, lung cancer, or other serious or fatal conditions. Plaintiffs worked without protective equipment and were unaware the white dust contained asbestos. The defendants did not know of the deteriorated condition of the insulation in and around the machinery. The 'sample' report attached to the complaint as an exhibit is not an air sample such that defendants would be aware of asbestos fibers floating or drifting in the air. The maintenance of the machinery would not, of necessity, cause the asbestos fibers in the insulation material to float or drift in the air and the defendants were not aware of that possibility.

The manufacturing operations at these facilities generated waste material that contaminated the Site. As a result, the Site and some surrounding areas presently contain elevated levels of cadmium, lead, and other metals. According to EPA assessments, the increased concentrations of metals in the area pose no short-term threats to nearby populations; however, the EPA has expressed general concern about potential long-term adverse health effects resulting from elevated amounts of cadmium. After taking note of the Site in 1980, the EPA conducted preliminary environmental assessments in following years pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ('CERCLA'), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq. In 1992, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency ('IEPA') also began to investigate the Site pursuant to its authority under Illinois law. As a result of the EPA's and IEPA's investigations and assessments, the EPA added the Site to the National Priorities List in 1999. This addition confirmed the Site's status as one of the most contaminated spots in the United States. In 1995, prior to the Site's official placement on the NPL, the Illinois Attorney General filed suit against Defendants' corporate predecessors in Illinois circuit court (at the IEPA's request) pursuant to the Illinois Environmental Protection Act ('the Illinois Act'), 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/22.2 & 42(d), (e). As a result of the Attorney General's suit, Defendants entered into an interim consent order ('Consent Order') with the People of the State of Illinois. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has described Defendants' responsibilities under the Consent Order as follows: 'Under this Consent Order, [Defendants] must perform a phased investigation of the site and implement certain interim remedies. [They] also must propose final remedies to the State of Illinois before completing final remedial action for the site. The Consent Order requires [Defendants] to perform . . . investigations and remedial actions in compliance with both the ICP (Illinois Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan) and the NCP (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency [*858] Plan). The State of Illinois, in consultation with the EPA, has sole discretion to decide if the final remedies proposed by [Defendants] are appropriate. The activities completed under the Consent Order are subject to approval by the State of Illinois.' Currently, Defendants are in the process of conducting remedial investigations and feasibility studies at the Site, i.e. gathering data about the nature and extent of the contamination and evaluating possible cleanup options. As part of this phase of the cleanup, Defendants are collecting information about possible risks to human health. The Consent Order expressly requires this type of health-related investigation. While, overall, Defendants are at the investigatory stage of the cleanup process, they have already implemented certain limited environmental remedies at the Site, including a dust control program and a water treatment system to treat surface water discharging into Lake DePue. After Defendants complete their remedial investigations, they will conduct design studies and, then, begin permanent remediation at the Site. Defendants have spent over $ 30 million in connection with Site cleanup, and it is undisputed that Defendants are fulfilling their responsibilities under the Consent Order. Dissatisfied with Defendants' rate of progress in cleaning up the Site, the Village decided to take matters into its own hands in August 2006. Pursuant to a local nuisance ordinance (Section 7-5-3 of the DePue Village Code), the Village posted 'Notice[s] to Abate Nuisance' at the Site. These notices directed Defendants to perform an immediate cleanup of the Site, under penalty of $ 750 for each day the Site remained a nuisance. In October 2006, the Village brought suit against Defendants in Illinois circuit court, alleging violations of the nuisance ordinance. The Village sought the following relief: a declaratory judgment that Defendants were in violation of the ordinance; fines of $ 750 for each day Defendants were in violation; and an injunction requiring Defendants to immediately complete a total cleanup of the Site. Id. Defendants removed the suit to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss. This Court granted the motion to dismiss, holding the Village's claims to be preempted by federal and state law. The Village appealed, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this Court's dismissal based on state law preemption. The Court of Appeals began its consideration of the state law preemption issue in DePue I by stressing the Village's status as a non-home-rule municipality with limited powers under the Illinois Constitution. Specifically, the court noted the Village's lack of authority to enforce any ordinance conflicting with the spirit and purpose of a state statute. The Court of Appeals went on to hold that the Village's use of its nuisance ordinance to force Defendants to perform an immediate cleanup of the Site undoubtedly conflicted with the spirit and purpose of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act. The court recognized, '[B]ecause environmental damage does not respect political boundaries, it is necessary to establish a unified statewide program for environmental protection . . . environmental problems are closely interrelated and must be dealt with as a unified whole in order to safeguard the environment.' Applying the preemption standard for non-home-rule municipalities in Illinois, the Court of Appeals concluded as follows: 'The Village's application of its nuisance ordinance seeks to address, in a heavy-handed manner, a difficult environmental problem that certainly is not only of local concern. If the Village were permitted to apply its nuisance ordinance to force [Defendants] to complete immediately the cleanup of the site, on penalty of $ 750 per day for noncompliance, then it could prevent compliance with the measured cleanup process adopted by Illinois through the Consent Order under the authority of Illinois law. Such a result would frustrate the purpose of the Illinois Act. The Illinois legislature enacted the Illinois Act in order to safeguard the environment and to restore contaminated areas through a phased and carefully considered  process. Ignoring this process by conducting and concluding a cleanup to the satisfaction of the Village is not a plan in service to the goals of the Illinois Act. The Village's application of its nuisance ordinance in this case is overreaching because it attempts to regulate an environmental hazard that is not local in nature and that already is subject to a cleanup under the authorization and direction of the state. Accordingly, we hold that the Village's claims are preempted by the Illinois Act.' Despite its loss in DePue I, the Village has initiated this second lawsuit, against the same defendants, based on the effects of pollution at the Site. There are some key differences this time around, however. First, the Village is now a home-rule unit of local government. According to the Amended Complaint, on November 4, 2008, Village of DePue voters passed a referendum to adopt home-rule status under the Illinois Constitution. As a home-rule municipality, the Village now has greater autonomy in governing its local affairs. The second difference is that the Village is suing under a new ordinance. On September 8, 2008 (after the Seventh Circuit issued its decision in DePue I) the Village enacted a new 'Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Substances' ordinance pursuant to authorization under a public health provision within the Illinois Municipal Code. On November 10, 2008, after becoming a home-rule municipality, the Village amended the ordinance to reflect municipal home-rule status. The amended ordinance prohibits any person, entity, or corporation from owning, controlling, or possessing 'real property by lease, trust or deed which contains hazardous wastes or hazardous substances.' The terms 'hazardous waste' and 'hazardous substances' are defined by cross-references to parallel provisions of the Illinois Act. In addition, the ordinance gives Village authorities the discretion to determine what is hazardous to public health and safety. The original version of the hazardous substances ordinance, enacted on September 8, 2008, provided for a fine of up to $ 750 per day of violation. The November 10, 2008 amendment increased that penalty significantly to a one-time fine of up to $ 50,000 and a recurring daily fine of up to $ 10,000. It seems apparent that the Village designed the November 10, 2008 amendment to target Defendants in connection with the Site. In a resolution adopted contemporaneously with the amendment, the Village charged Defendants with adversely affecting the health and safety of Village residents by maintaining hazardous substances at the Site. With this resolution, the Village slapped Defendants with the maximum fines allowed under the amended ordinance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

At about noon on the following day, May 5, Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti proceeded to the wooded area described by Alma and looked for fresh holes.

At the time, the officer knew she and Mrs. Lucchetti were on someone's property, but she had no idea whose property, as the property was in an 'abandoned' state. Detective Hendle testified that the property was wooded and overrun with weeds with piles of junk on it and trails leading throughout. Mr. Stevens did not tell the officer that she was trespassing on his property, and Detective Hendle did not observe any signs stating 'no trespassing,' 'keep out,' or anything else of that nature. Mrs. Lucchetti informed Detective Hendle that kids rode their all-terrain vehicles on the wooded property. Kids were present on the property on the date that Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti were there, but the officer could not recall if they were on all-terrain vehicles or walking. Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti returned to the Lucchetti residence where they met with Alma Lopez. Alma then accompanied the detective back to the wooded area to show the officer where she and her friends had found the money. Alma pointed out two holes in the center of the property which were, according to the officer, about six to eight inches across and angled downward so that their depth was indeterminable. A pile of dirt was outside the holes as though an animal had burrowed into the ground. Alma told Detective Hendle that she had returned the money she found to the hole and thrown a little bit of dirt over it. The officer dug in the area with a stick but did not find anything. Detective Hendle recalled that Alma asked the officer what would happen if the money could be found. The officer told Alma that if she and her friends had kept the money for safekeeping, she should tell Mrs. Lucchetti or the officer so that 'everything could be handled properly.' If handled properly, the possibility existed that Alma and her friends might be able to claim the money in the future. Detective Hendle did not personally recover any money from Alma or her friends. About 10:30 p.m. on May 5, 1990, Detective Tom Monday of the McHenry County sheriff's police met with Jennifer Moore and her parents at their home. Jennifer told the officer that she and three of her friends [Alma Lopez, Thomas Farrell, and Ryan Baassler] had found a large amount of money in a vacant lot. According to Jennifer, Alma had lied to Detective Hendle because Alma still possessed the money she found. Jennifer admitted that she had some of the money, and she turned it over to the officer. At about 11 p.m. of the same day the officer proceeded to the Lopez residence and recovered the money Alma possessed. At approximately 11:53 p.m. Detective Monday arrived at Thomas Farrell's house and collected Thomas' portion of the found money. From there the officer proceeded to the home of Ryan Baassler where he recovered more of the money. At the home of each of the minors the officer prepared a property inventory sheet, depicting the amount of money recovered, and had the minor sign it. Detective Monday testified that he recovered the money from the minors for safekeeping purposes until the true owner or one determined to be the rightful owner came forward. Jennifer Moore, who was 14 years old at the time of the discovery of the money, related that she found the money in the woods across the street from her house. Jennifer stated that kids customarily ventured into the wooded area, that no signs warned them not to go on the property, that the owner never asked them to stay off the property, that other neighborhood children played on the property, and that the property contained trails for allterrain vehicles and bicycles. Jennifer stated that she found the money on April 30 or May 1 at about 4:30 or 5 p.m. She and Thomas Farrell were walking through the woods when she discovered two holes. Jennifer kicked a mound of dirt next to one of the holes and saw some loose money. Jennifer and Thomas were joined by Alma and Ryan. All four minors grabbed as much money as they could and ran to Jennifer's house where they went behind a shed and counted the money. After Alma, Thomas, and Ryan went home Jennifer hid her money; she did not tell her parents about the money. The following Saturday Jennifer and two of her friends went shopping. Jennifer gave each friend $ 100 of the money. The friends returned to Jennifer any money which they did not spend. On that same day Jennifer told her mother about her discovery. That evening Detective Monday arrived, and Jennifer gave him all the money she possessed. Later, she recovered from her friends the items they bought and returned them. Jennifer was able to recover all the money spent except the money expended for a T-shirt, which could not be returned, and $ 5 to $ 10 spent on food. Jennifer gave the recovered money and the T-shirt to Detective Monday. Jennifer acknowledged that she did not file any documents with the court within five days of May 1, 1990, claiming ownership of the money. Jennifer did not know whether her parents took such action. According to Thomas Farrell, who was 13 years old at the time of the discovery, the money was found on May 1 while he and some friends were wandering in the woods behind a house [the Stevens' house]. Thomas related that Jennifer was looking down a hole and that she turned around and kicked over some dirt, making the money visible. Thomas recalled that the money was not 'really loose' but that he was 'pretty sure it was organized by string or rubber band or just stacked together.' By the time Alma and Ryan joined Thomas and Jennifer, Jennifer was holding the money in her hands, and the others grabbed some money from her. The minors then ran to the shed behind Jennifer's house and counted the larger bills. When Thomas arrived home, he told his mother and father about the money. His father advised him to count the money, place it in an envelope, and put it with his deposit slips. Thomas stated that he did not spend any of the money. Thomas recalled that on May 5 at about 10:30 p.m. Detective Monday picked up the money Thomas had kept. According to Thomas, the officer told him to wait six months to see if anyone claimed the money and if no one did, the money would belong to the minors. According to Thomas, the officer indicated that there was nothing further Thomas was required to do except to wait. Thomas acknowledged that he never filed any document at the courthouse claiming ownership of the money prior to the time Detective Monday arrived at his house. Alma Lopez, 15 years old at the time of the discovery, described the place where the money was found as having lots of weeds, trees, and trails. Alma stated that she had been in the area many times and that she had never been asked by the owner to stay out of the area nor had she ever seen any 'no trespassing' signs posted. Alma related that she and the other minors were just wandering around in the area on April 30 or May 1 when Jennifer called to Alma and Ryan. When they joined Jennifer, the money was, according to Alma, on the ground stacked together with a rubber band. Jennifer picked up the money, and the minors all took some of it. Alma recounted that she and the other minors went to Jennifer's house and counted the money behind Jennifer's shed before going home. When Alma arrived home, her father told her not to do anything with the money. He took possession of the money and hid it. He never advised her to call the police. Alma admitted that when Detective Hendle and Mrs. Lucchetti spoke with her on May 4, she lied about knowing where the money was because she wanted to keep it. When Detective Monday appeared at her house on May 5, Alma turned the money over to him. The officer told her that she would have to wait six months to see if anybody claimed the money. Alma acknowledged that between the date on which she and the others found the money and May 5 she made no effort to find the true owner or to file any documents at the courthouse claiming ownership of the money. Ryan Baassler, 13 years old at the time the minors discovered the money, described the property where the money was found as 'wooded' or 'wild' with a couple of trails through it. According to Ryan, Jennifer and Thomas were walking in the wooded area on May 1, 1990, with Alma and Ryan following behind when Jennifer found some money on the ground and picked it up. Ryan remembered the money was loose 'with no fasteners around it.' Ryan said he took some money from Jennifer's hands. Then, all the minors proceeded to Jennifer's house where they made a rough count of the money. When Ryan arrived home, he put his money in his closet. He did not tell his parents about the money until Detective Monday came to recover it on May 5 because he wanted to keep the money. When Detective Monday arrived on the night of May 5, Ryan turned over to the officer the money he still possessed. Subsequently, Ryan recovered $ 145 he had given his mother to put in the bank and also replaced with his own money the money he had spent on a couple of T-shirts. Ryan recalled hearing Detective Monday state that there was a six-month waiting period and if no one claimed the money within that time, the money would be returned to the minors. Ryan acknowledged that he never tried to find the true owner of the money between the time of the discovery and the time of Detective Monday's recovery nor did he file any documents at the courthouse claiming ownership of the money. Thomas Farrell, Sr., testified that he was present on the evening of May 5 when Detective Monday came to collect the money found by his son. Mr. Farrell related that he wondered if his son was obligated to try to contact the rightful owner or if his son could claim ownership of the money if the rightful owner was not found. Consequently, he asked Detective Monday if there was any further action that needed to be undertaken. Detective Monday replied negatively. According to Mr. Farrell, he assumed from the officer's negative response that his son had no further obligations or responsibilities under the law. Mr. Farrell acknowledged that he did not file any documents with the court claiming ownership of the money for his son nor did he attempt to find the true owner."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

Defendants cut down the south half of a hedge fence which for many years prior to February, 1915, stood upon the line between the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the east forty) and the southwest quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 (hereinafter referred to as the west forty). On and prior to February 13, 1866, both of these forty-acre tracts belonged to a man named Teadrow. On February 13, 1866, Teadrow conveyed the west forty to Benjamin Newman, and on February 15, 1866, conveyed the east forty to Oliver P. Rice. When these conveyances were made there was a hedge fence on the north half of the line and a wooden fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. In 1868 Benjamin Newman, the owner of the west forty, removed the wooden fence and set out a hedge fence on the south half of the line between the two tracts. Thereafter, during the separate ownership of the tracts, Banjamin Newman trimmed and otherwise cared for the hedge fence on the south half of the line and Rice trimmed and looked after the hedge fence on the north half of the line. In December, 1888, Rice conveyed the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16 to Benjamin Newman, the latter thereby becoming the owner of both tracts. Thereafter, during the ownership of both tracts by Benjamin Newman, he required the tenants of the west forty to take care of the south half and the tenants of the east forty to take care of the north half of the hedge fence on the line between the two tracts. On June 22, 1904, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to his daughter, F. Eva Newman, the plaintiff, who has since married J. O. Conklin, a warranty deed, conveying to her two hundred acres of land, including the southeast quarter of the northeast quarter of said section 16, referred to herein as the east forty, but not including the tract referred to herein as the west forty. This deed contained the provision that 'this deed is not to take effect until after the death of the grantor, Benjamin Newman.' The wife of Benjamin Newman, who is still living, did not join in the conveyance. At the same time plaintiff executed and delivered to her father the following written instrument signed by her: 'Whereas Benjamin Newman has this day conveyed to me certain tracts and parcels of land in Pike county, Illinois, to take effect after his death, I hereby agree to pay the taxes on said land in lieu of all rents that I would otherwise have to pay, (this does not affect any rent that is now due,) and in consideration of my paying said taxes I am to receive all the rents, profits, etc., that may accrue on said land.' When the conveyance was made to plaintiff the tract in controversy known as the east forty was in the possession of Joseph Gifford as tenant and the west forth was in the possession of John B. Newman, a grandson of Benjamin Newman, as tenant of Benjamin Newman. After the delivery of the deed and delivery of possession of the east forty to plaintiff, Benjamin Newman told his tenants of the west forty, and as late as September, 1913, stated to Defendants and others, that the north half of the fence belonged to the east forty and the south half to the west forty. On September 19, 1910, Benjamin Newman executed and delivered to appellant Lee Newman, a son of appellant George R. Newman and a grandson of Benjamin Newman, a lease to the west forty from March 1, 1913, to the first day of March after the death of [***6] Benjamin Newman, in consideration of the agreement of the lessee to pay the taxes assessed against the land each year. At the same time he turned over the delivered to Lee Newman a warranty deed dated February 11, 1908, whereby he conveyed to his son, George R. Newman, the tract known as the west forty for life and the remainder to the children of George R. Newman. This deed also contained the provision that it should not take effect until after the death of the grantor. It was not signed by the grantor's wife, and it seems to have remained in the possession of the grantor until it was delivered to Lee Newman, who in 1914 filed it for record. During the month of January, 1915, a controversy arose between plaintiff and Defendants regarding the ownership of the hedge fence, each party claiming the south half of the fence. During the month of February, 1915, Defendants, over the protest of plaintiff, cut down the south half of the hedge fence on the line between the east forty and the west forty and erected a wire fence in the place thereof."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

These lots owned by Mundelein Realty Corporation were being developed as part of the Bel-Aire subdivision by Isidor Simon, doing business as I. Simon & Son, a codefendant. Isidor Simon and his son, codefendant Ned B. Simon, were officers of the Mundelein Realty Corporation. In order to prepare its land for development and ultimate occupancy, Mundelein Realty Corporation balanced its land by removing topsoil and trees so that sewers, streets, water mains, curbs, fire hydrants and gutters could be installed. It is undisputed that in the course of this activity the defendant corporation balanced the plaintiff's property and removed topsoil and trees therefrom. Plaintiff testified that in the fall of 1963 she went upon her property, whereupon she discovered that one of her two lots had been stripped of topsoil and that some of the trees had been removed. She immediately went to the office of the Bel-Aire concern managed by the defendant, I. Simon & Son. After informing a representative of the office that her property had been damaged, the plaintiff was told that she could 'help herself' to the pile of black dirt which had been gathered from the stripping of the lots. Subsequent to this conversation, the plaintiff testified that gravel was placed upon her property, that parking signs had been erected on it, and that the remainder of topsoil on her other lot had been removed. Plaintiff's attorney sent a letter to Mundelein Realty Corporation and demanded that the signs and gravel be removed and demanded reimbursement for the removal of the topsoil and the severance of the trees. Ned B. Simon responded on behalf of the corporation that the gravel and signs would be removed but also defiantly informed the plaintiff that she would be held to pay for the improvements that the defendant had made on adjacent properties to the extent those improvements enhanced the value of the two lots.

Southbound passenger trains take the west track and northbound trains the east track. Between these two main tracks, from the switch tower to the depot and public square, there is a space a little over ten feet wide filled level with the tops of the ties with cinders and ballast, making a smooth, even walk and path, which is traveled and used by defendant's employees and others quite generally, both for business and pleasure. Persons who have occasion to go that way use the path, and people are accustomed to walk out along the path on Sundays for recreation. There is a public road adjoining the right of way on the west, leading into the public square at Carbondale, but the path between the tracks makes a better walk, especially in muddy weather. Between the tower and the depot there are junctions of branch lines or divisions with the main line, and there are also side tracks in addition to the two main tracks. At the time of the accident the fast mail train due at Carbondale at 11:20 A.M. was approaching from the north. The day was clear and the weather very warm. There was nothing to obstruct the view of the train, or the view from the train of any person on the track. The deceased was walking from the north between the main tracks toward the public square and depot. The train whistled north of the switch tower, and at that point took the west track. As the train approached, the deceased was a short distance north of a switch stand which was a little over seven hundred feet north of the depot. The train was running about fifteen miles an hour, and there was an ordinance limiting the speed of passenger trains within the city to ten miles an hour. Until the train was close to him the deceased was walking in the center between the two tracks, and was entirely out of danger. The engineer was on the right side of the cab, in his place, and the head of the engine cut off his view of the deceased about one hundred and twenty-five feet before reaching him. As the train approached, the deceased veered toward the track the train was on, and just before he was struck was seen by the postal clerk, a switch hand and another witness to be in a position of danger. The judgment of the postal clerk, in his testimony for the plaintiff, was that the train was within one hundred feet of the deceased when it was plain to be seen that he was going toward the track, and that he was within four or five feet of the engine when it seemed as though he was close enough to be struck by it. Plaintiff's witnesses differed somewhat in their opinions as to the distance from the train when he came close enough to the track to be struck by the engine, but they agreed that it was a very short distance. The switch hand testified that at the time the deceased was struck he was wiping the sweat off from his face; that he took a handkerchief out of his right-hand hip pocket and wiped off the sweat just as he was struck. The witness beckoned to him to get away from the track and also called to him, but could not make him hear. The pilot-beam extended over the rail sixteen or eighteen inches, -- about as far as the ends of the ties. No signal was given and the speed of the train was not checked."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

Over the course of his life, Plaintiff has been prescribed various medications to help him control his emotions and behavior, including Ritalin, Valporic Acid, Elavil, Risperdal, Trazodone, Prozac, Depakote, Tegretol, Thorazine, Metylphenadite, Inderal LA, and Clonidine.

While he was incarcerated at Cook County, Plaintiff met with physicians and received his prescribed medication.

Plaintiff then asked to speak with Cross's supervising lieutenant, a request that Cross also ignored. Cross returned to Plaintiff's cell after lunch to collect his lunch tray. At that time Plaintiff again asked to receive his medication and to see a psychiatrist. When Cross ignored Plaintiff's request, Plaintiff refused to surrender his lunch tray. After several demands for the return of the lunch tray, Cross verbally assaulted and threatened Plaintiff. Cross then entered Plaintiff's cell, where Plaintiff stood passively holding his hands behind his back. Cross wrapped his handcuffs around his fists and began striking Plaintiff. Plaintiff used his hands and then his lunch tray to deflect the blows. Cross continued to beat Plaintiff, and Plaintiff screamed for help and hit Cross in the head with his lunch tray. Cross grabbed Plaintiff by the neck, choking him, and Plaintiff eventually dropped the lunch tray. When Cross released Plaintiff, Plaintiff tried to flee his cell.

After Plaintiff already had been restrained, Griffin sprayed Plaintiff in the eyes with pepper gas. Defendants then continued assaulting Plaintiff by repeatedly kicking him in the face and ribs. Defendants finally dragged Plaintiff to a holding area where a tactical team arrived to record Plaintiff on video. With the tactical team present, Plaintiff was taken to a shower to wash off the chemicals from the pepper gas. Following the shower, Plaintiff was evaluated by the medical staff.

John Castoro is the Chief Executive Officer and owns approximately 50% of Custom Aluminum's stock. Steven Dillett, as President, is responsible for overall profitability and long-term positioning structure for the company. In 1994, Plaintiff James Marks was hired as a general foreman. Five years later, he was promoted to Plant Manager and held that position until his termination on October 12, 2005. Marks and Castoro socialized outside of work, played video golf together, and exchanged gifts. At work, they frequently took long lunches together, accompanied by Patrick Breslin, personal assistant to John Castoro. Marks and John Castoro had frequent physical interactions; 'playful conduct, such as hitting each other on the arm and giving one another bear hugs.' Castoro owns knives, brought them to work, and on one occasion used a knife to shave the hair off Marks' and Breslin's arms. Castoro also kept a gun in his office because he feared that terminated employees might return. Castoro frequently brought his Rottweiler to work, an animal that terrified several employees at Custom Aluminum. On July 25, 2005, Marks was injured at work. Marks was out of work from August 30 or 31 until September 19, 2005. The pain from this injury was so severe that Marks was admitted to the hospital and treated with 'a lot of painkillers.' When he returned to work, he was restricted from lifting using the right side of his body and had to attend physical therapy three to four days per week, for about two hours per day beginning at 1 or 1:30 p.m. Marks complained frequently to other employees about the severe pain he suffered. His coworker, Elizabeth Ayala, noted that he looked like he was in pain constantly. Ayala witnessed Castoro hitting Marks, describing such interaction as 'kidding and playing around' in which Marks would tell Castoro not to hit him on his bad (right) arm and offer up his good (left) arm instead. Ayala heard Marks say 'ow' on the occasions he was hit. Upon Marks' return, Castoro made comments to Marks such as 'you've got a bad flipper,' 'you're no longer fun' 'you're no good to me,' and 'I won't have my lunch buddy anymore.' Castoro [made the remarks because] he was simply hurt that Marks could not go to lunch regularly, or if he was able to attend, could not drink or play video games as they had once done. On Friday, October 7, 2005, Castoro 'slapped' Marks on his left arm twice. The second time Castoro hit him, Marks responded by slapping Castoro on the head - an action Castoro testified he understood to mean that Marks didn't want Castoro to hit him anymore. On Monday morning, October 10, Castoro entered Marks' office where Marks was discussing plans for the Christmas party with Ayala. According to Castoro, he 'greeted' Marks by 'slapping' his left (uninjured) arm. Marks responded by swearing at Castoro and throwing a pen at him. Castoro responded by telling Marks to leave; he also said Marks should take some time off and suggested that he might not need to come back at all. Castoro had the authority to fire employees and had done so in the past by sending the employee home in the middle of the day. Accordingly, Marks left, believing that he had been fired. Shortly thereafter, Castoro was advised that the company had received a call from 'an insurance person, maybe a workers' compensation person' who inquired as to Marks' employment status, having learned that Marks was terminated. Castoro then shut off Marks' company cell phone service and changed the locks on his office door."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Battery"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

This remained the operative rule on August 27, 2013.

[The defendant] Ms. Di Buono testified that she had been a professional dog walker for years, with clients at Union Square since 2011. In early 2012, [the plaintiff] Mrs. Geraci and Ms. Di Buono had an encounter. At that time, Ms. Di Buono was waiting for the elevator on the fifth floor of Union Square with three dogs belonging to resident clients. She testified that she was not aware at that time of the rule mandating no more than two dogs when moving through common areas. Mrs. Geraci and her husband were on the elevator when it stopped on the fifth floor. Both Geracis screamed at [Di Buono] until the doors closed, leaving her shaken when she discussed the rules with a security officer. Mrs. Geraci testified that, on August 27, 2013, she left her home in the early afternoon. That afternoon [Ms. Di Buono] parked her car in front of Union Square to pick up the dogs of two clients in the building. Ms. Di Buono waited on the fifth floor with the two dogs to take the elevator to the lobby. When the elevator arrived, Mrs. Geraci was on it. Ms. Di Buono was looking down as the elevator opened on the fifth floor to make sure the dogs' paws did not catch in the gap at the elevator threshold. She testified her normal practice was to ask permission before boarding an occupied elevator, but she did not see anyone else in the car when she got onto the elevator that day. Once Ms. Di Buono was on the elevator, she pushed the button and immediately 'felt hands and nails on me from the back [t]rying to push me.' She testified that she broke free and turned around to see it was Mrs. Geraci, who screamed 'who do [you] think you [are]? What [are you] doing on this elevator? I told you to get off.' Ms. Di Buono she warned 'you just blew it now. You just did that on camera.' In fact, however, Ms. Di Buono was mistaken and there were no cameras on the elevator.

The circumstances in which this occurred were described by two witnesses for plaintiff, Richard Klein and Michael Dome, during their testimony at the trial. At approximately 2 a.m., October 29, 1971, Trout, Klein and Dome were riding together, each on a separate motorcycle, in an easterly direction on West Main Street in Belleville, Illinois. Over a period of two or three months prior to that time, Trout, Klein, and Dome had become accustomed to riding their motorcycles together each Thursday night. On this particular occasion, they had ridden on some rural roads near Caseyville, Illinois and then returned to Belleville, where each of them lived. While en route home, they discussed the possibility of stopping for something to eat at a Belleville restaurant. Klein decided to return to his home. The other two decided that they would go to a restaurant but that they would first ride along with Klein to his home. The Bank of Belleville is located at 48th and West Main streets in Belleville. Along side the bank is a parking lot and 'drive-up' teller windows. On the northern side of the lot is West Main Street; on the opposite side is Washington Street. Apparently, although it is not totally clear from the testimony or trial exhibits, there were driveways on both the West Main Street side and the Washington Street side of the lot. Along the western side of the bank lot, but separated from it by a curb, is a driveway or alleyway, on the opposite side of which is a flower shop. As the three motorcycle riders approached this portion of West Main Street, Trout and Klein were close together; Dome was approximately 150 feet behind them. Taking a 'shortcut,' Klein turned into the alleyway and Trout turned into the bank lot. Klein anticipated that Trout would have to exit from the lot in the same way that he had entered, because Klein was aware of the chain across the bank lot. However, as Klein neared Washington Street he heard a crash. He proceeded to Washington Street, drove into the bank lot and discovered Trout lying on the pavement and his motorcycle on its side on the pavement. When Dome reached the bank lot, he turned into the bank lot and waited. Dome anticipated that Trout would come out of the lot the same way he had entered it because Dome was also aware of the chain stretched across the bank lot. When Trout did not come out, Dome drove further onto the lot to see what had occurred. He also found Trout and the motorcycle lying on the pavement. The chain into which Trout had driven ran parallel to West Main Street and Washington Street at a distance of approximately 175 feet from West Main Street. The chain was approximately 70 feet long and was a dark color much the same as the color of the parking lot pavement. The chain was strung from a post on one end, through a series of three standards spaced at equal intervals across the lot, and to a post on the other end, thus making a total of four spans. The distance of the chain from the pavement was approximately 30 to 36 inches. On each of the three standards was a 'no thoroughfare' sign. Two stopsigns [*86] had been rung on the chain, one on the easternmost span and one on the next span. However, no stopsign had been hung on the other two spans. (Defendant had driven into the westernmost span.) According to Dome, one driving through the lot on the same route that Trout had taken would not be able to see the stopsigns unless that person looked to his left. At 2 a.m. on October 29, 1971, the weather was clear. The bank lot was well lit by a number of mercury vapor lights; however, near the westernmost portion of the chain was a tree which partially shaded that area from the lights. The chain was up once in a while at night in the bank lot. Klein and Trout had never ridden through the bank lot together at night, although they had ridden through together once during the day."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

Texaco used underground storage tanks, gasoline dispenser islands, and piping under the station, as well as an auto lift and grease pit. In the 1960s, during Texaco's operation of the station, contaminants were leaked from at least two underground storage tanks. The Texaco Station has been vacant since the late 1990s. E-Town acquired legal title to the property in April 2002. In the meantime, in 2000, the Illinois State Fire Marshal conducted an exploratory excavation of the Texaco Station. The Fire Marshal issued a Notice of Violation, concluding that at least two unregistered underground storage tanks were abandoned improperly and that the underground storage tanks contained water and gasoline and were leaking in close proximity to a sewer. In April 2001, the Fire Marshal issued a report stating: nothing has been done to this site. The tanks are still leaking and no caps are on the vents, fills, or product lines. They are continuing to take on water. In March 2012, an environmental consultant hired by Evanston issued a report noting the presence of petroleum exceeding the amounts allowed by state regulations. A subsequent report issued in July 2012 noted the presence of two 2,000-gallon underground storage tanks filled with water and gasoline and two 3,000-gallon underground storage tanks filled with sand. That second report concluded that contamination was migrating from the Texaco Station to Church and Darrow Streets and could possibly affect commercial and residential properties to the east. As a result of Texaco's conduct, the soil and groundwater at the Texaco Station and adjacent city-owned and privately-owned property are contaminated with petroleum, gasoline, and their byproducts, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead.

He had not been sitting there long when his brother told him plaintiff was coming. Hastily putting away his papers he had been examining, he told his brother to go away, as he did not wish him mixed up in the affair. Plaintiff was then some considerable distance away, walking on the highway in the direction of defendant, carrying his gun on his shoulder with his arm over the breech and his hand thrust into his bosom. As plaintiff approached, defendant took a rest on the corner of the fence for his gun, and when he was near enough, defendant, taking deliberate aim, shot him. Defendant says plaintiff still appeared to be advancing towards him when he fired the other barrel of his gun at him. The gun used by defendant had a double barrel; one was loaded with powder and leaden ball, and the other with powder and small 'turkey shot' or 'small buck shot.' The one first discharged was the rifle ball, which took effect in plaintiff's left breast, passing through a part of the lungs and coming out near the shoulder blade, and the shot from the other barrel took effect in his leg. It is not probable plaintiff either saw defendant or was aware of his presence in that immediate vicinity until he was shot. In giving an account of the affair at the office of the justice of the peace, soon after it happened, defendant says he did not think plaintiff saw him until after he fired the second shot. Apparently defendant was under no mental excitement whatever, but coolly and deliberately planned to take the life of plaintiff. According to his own statement he was not nervous, and his own account, expressive of his intention, is: 'I intended to kill; that was my purpose when I shot.' Other testimony is to the effect he expressed regret that he had not killed plaintiff, and that he was 'afraid he would have to do it over.' The only defense insisted upon is, that plaintiff had, at an election held some twenty days before, and perhaps on some other occasions about that time, threatened to take the life of defendant, and the reason assigned was, that defendant had accused plaintiff of being guilty of a petty larceny. In giving his testimony, defendant was permitted to state that such threats had been communicated to him previous to the shooting; that he believed plaintiff would carry his threats into execution; that he believed, if they should meet, one or the other would be killed, and that he shot him to save his own life. There is no pretense plaintiff had made any effort to carry such threats into execution, either at the time of shooting or at any other time. There is no evidence that defendant expected plaintiff at that place on that morning, nor that he took his position with a view to wait for him; but it is proven that, after he saw him coming, he did lie in wait for him, and, from the place where he was concealed from the view of plaintiff, shot him, when plaintiff was not aware of his presence in the vicinity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Battery"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

Apparently defendant was under no mental excitement whatever, but coolly and deliberately planned to take the life of plaintiff. According to his own statement he was not nervous, and his own account, expressive of his intention, is: 'I intended to kill; that was my purpose when I shot.' Other testimony is to the effect he expressed regret that he had not killed plaintiff, and that he was 'afraid he would have to do it over.' The only defense insisted upon is, that plaintiff had, at an election held some twenty days before, and perhaps on some other occasions about that time, threatened to take the life of defendant, and the reason assigned was, that defendant had accused plaintiff of being guilty of a petty larceny. In giving his testimony, defendant was permitted to state that such threats had been communicated to him previous to the shooting; that he believed plaintiff would carry his threats into execution; that he believed, if they should meet, one or the other would be killed, and that he shot him to save his own life. There is no pretense plaintiff had made any effort to carry such threats into execution, either at the time of shooting or at any other time. There is no evidence that defendant expected plaintiff at that place on that morning, nor that he took his position with a view to wait for him; but it is proven that, after he saw him coming, he did lie in wait for him, and, from the place where he was concealed from the view of plaintiff, shot him, when plaintiff was not aware of his presence in the vicinity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Self_Defense"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

South of this tract owned by them and on which their fireworks buildings are located at intervals of 50 or 60 feet, they rent a small tract adjoining, lying on the west side of King Street and west of plaintiff's property. Defendants manufactured fireworks upon their premises and would test these fireworks, or exhibit the different kinds to purchasers, by shooting or firing them. To do this they would cross King Street from the southeast corner of their property to the northwest corner of the Gerrard property and fire the same (either by attaching them to Gerrard's west fence or to his north fence), by frequently setting pieces on the tops of posts or attaching the pieces to them, and in this way they had frequently split and slivered posts in his fence. Most of the time they would go east along the fence on Gerrard's north line down to the southeast corner of the cornfield on the Wherry property, and just west of Wherry's pasture and fire them from that place, and when firing aerial bombs they would set what they call mortars of steel, with a bottom in them four inches or a little more in inside diameter, on end, and the lower end five or six inches in the ground and then put the bombs in these mortars and fire them into the air. The mortars might set on an incline as they are not tested, and the paper may be ignited and set fire. The bombs were constructed with a powder charge in the bottom to which a fuse was attached, and this was exploded for the purpose of elevating the bombs into the air, and how high they would go depended upon the amount of powder they had put in this bottom charge. Previously parts of these bombs, or remnants of the casing used in covering the fireworks, had exploded, had been thrown or carried over on to plaintiff's property and had set fires. Pieces of exploded fireworks had alighted upon the barn back of plaintiff's house and had alighted on the premises south of plaintiff's and had set fires, and the fence had been damaged and destroyed by the explosion of fireworks and he had been compelled to rebuild the same. Plaintiff had made complaints to each of the defendants and had warned them to stop firing on or upon his fence, and not to fire anything that would fall upon his premises or endanger the same, and one of the defendants had gone over on the premises and looked at a place where fire had been communicated and offered to pay the damage. On the day of the fire, the evidence shows Antonio Gerino had come down from Chicago to buy some fireworks and wanted an exhibition of some of the ones that he proposed to purchase. After 5 o'clock, which was quitting time in the fireworks plant, Wilson Halls, Paul Porcheddu and Tony Gerino went down to the southeast corner of the plant, crossed over to the east side of King Street upon the Wherry premises along plaintiff's north line for the purpose of showing Mr. Gerino what the fireworks were like and what kind of an exhibition they made when exploded. Several shots were fired down near the southeast corner of the little cornfield on the Wherry land; and that after the last explosion, which was a very loud one, the steel cap fell upon the roof of plaintiff's house and rolled off on to the ground with some pieces of shingles which it had split off or knocked off in falling; that the distance from where the shot was fired to plaintiff's house was about 300 feet, and in a very short time after the bomb cap struck the roof of the house and rolled off, fire was discovered on the roof and there was no one else who fired any fireworks in that vicinity and no firing of any blast of any other kind within a mile or more of the premises. Plaintiff states that previous to firing his house they had set two fires in his orchard, and that he went over and got Joe Porcheddu and took him over and showed him where it had burned and where the remains of a skyrocket or some other fireworks piece had alighted in the grass in the orchard.

The defendant below, appellee here, introduced in evidence the declaration, pleas, instructions, verdict, judgment, and other proceedings in a certain trespass suit, brought to the September term, 1902, of said court by the present appellant, Herschbach, against the present appellee, Cohen. In the trespass suit the declaration charged that the defendant, Cohen, [***3] cut and destroyed the timber of the plaintiff of the value of $500.00, 'then growing and being in and upon certain lands of the plaintiff there situate, being part of surveys 222 and 223, * * * and took and carried away the said * * * timber and converted and disposed of the same to his own use,' etc. To the declaration in the trespass suit two pleas were filed, one, a plea of not guilty, and the other, a plea of liberum tenementum. In the latter plea it was set up, 'that the close in the said declaration mentioned, and in which, etc., now is and at the time when, etc., was the close, soil and freehold of the defendant.' The instructions in the trespass suit instructed the jury as to the boundary line between adjoining owners on the island and mainland, and as to the location of the slough, claimed to be the boundary line between the two tracts, and as to its change of position by reason of the change in the bed or current of the river. The trial in the trespass suit was before a jury, and the jury therein returned a verdict on September 15, 1902, finding the defendant therein, the present appellee, not guilty. Motion for a new trial in the trespass suit was overruled, and judgment [***4] was rendered in favor of defendant on the verdict and against the plaintiff therein, the present appellant, for costs of suit. Upon the trial below of the present ejectment suit, the following stipulation was made between the parties: 'It is admitted that the land, sued for in this case, is the same land that was involved in an action in trespass commenced by Mr. Herschbach, the plaintiff, against Cohen, the defendant, which was finally disposed of at the September term, 1902, of this court; it is agreed that, when all the evidence is in on this question of former adjudication, if the court holds that the plea of former adjudication is not a defense in this suit, then judgment shall pass for the plaintiff, with right to a new trial according to the statute, or appeal if desired.' It is not denied on the part of the appellee that the appellant herein is the owner of the said surveys numbered 222 and 223; and it is not denied, on the part of the appellant, that the appellee is the owner of said island, lying west of the western boundary of said surveys. It was proven that, upon the trial of the trespass suit, 'both plaintiff and defendant introduced evidence to locate the boundaries [***5] of the two claims and surveys, numbered 222 and 223, and to locate the slough, as it was at the time the government surveyed these surveys, and to locate it, as it was at the time of the trial of that suit; and that the object of the evidence was to ascertain whether the timber cut was cut on the land of the plaintiff, or of the defendant, in that cause; that the plaintiff and defendant in that suit were respectively the plaintiff and defendant in this suit; that the plaintiff made preliminary proof of the fact, that the timber was cut, and that it was cut on the land between the two sloughs, shown on 'Exhibit A' introduced in this case, which is the same plat used in that case; that the defendant did not deny the cutting of the timber, but that there was some little evidence as to the value of the timber cut; that the great bulk of the evidence of numerous witnesses was as to where that slough was at the time of the government survey, and where it was at the time of the trial of the case, plaintiff contending that it never had moved, and defendant contending that it had moved to the point 'A' on exhibits 1 and 2.' The land, here in controversy, is 18.24 acres lying between two sloughs, [***6] or arms of the Mississippi river, appellant contending that his land extended as far as the westernmost slough called in the evidence the 'original slough,' and appellee claiming that appellant's land only extended as far as the easternmost of the two sloughs, marked '1-2,' the land between the two being 18.24 acres."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

After verifying Lombardi's identity, Range informed Lombardi that she was under arrest and placed her in custody. Outside Lombardi's home, Range grabbed Lombardi's right arm and turned her around to handcuff her. Lombardi voluntarily placed her left arm behind her back, and Range handcuffed both hands together. Range, holding Lombardi's right forearm, then proceeded with her across the lawn in the direction of Range's squad car.

Range then threw Lombardi into the backseat of the squad car, causing her to hit the left side of her head on the door frame of the car, scrape her knees on the back of the front seat and on a steel plate in the squad car, and hit her left shoulder and rib cage against steel binders on the back seat. Lombardi sustained bruises to her head; a bleeding scalp; a concussion; blurred vision; scraped, bruised, and bloody knees; a torn rotator cuff; a torn meniscus; disc injury; a headache; and lower back pain that made it difficult for her to walk.

The clear preponderance of the evidence is, that the plaintiff was employed by a number of persons, students, sometimes in the case spoken of as a club, to act as housekeeper for them, they taking their meals in the premises, she superintending the preparation of the same and receiving as her compensation, board for herself and daughters, and if anything was realized over and above the expense of running this boarding house, a small compensation. According to her testimony all that she received for her entire services over and above board for herself and daughters was $ 20. Some time in August, 1898, an arrangement was made between Rugh, the lessee, and Mead & Coe, that Rugh would surrender his lease and give up possession of said premises at the close of that month, so that Mead & Coe would have the place for another tenant on September 2d. The $ 20 was one month's rent, namely, for the month of August, and that was allowed to Rugh. The plaintiff knew of and assented to this arrangement and in pursuance thereof rented another flat for her use, beginning on the first day of September. Each student paid $ 2.50 a week for his board. Rugh collected this from them, bought provisions and paid the bills, including the rent. It does not appear that either Mead or Coe knew by whom the premises were occupied, although their agent, Hammond, saw the plaintiff a number of times during the tenancy. There was no evidence tending to show that there had been sub-letting of the premises to the plaintiff or assignment of the lease to her. The written paper itself was handed to her by one Hurlbut about the 1st of August, but there is nothing tending to show that Rugh or the plaintiff, or any one interested in the lease, ever thought that the plaintiff had become liable for the payment of the rent or the performance of any of the conditions of the lease. Upon the morning of September 2d, the lease having been terminated by agreement and it being understood by all parties that the plaintiff would be out of the place by the first of September, calciminers and decorators were sent to the flat to put it in condition for another tenant. They gained access to the house without opposition and proceeded with their work with the assent of the plaintiff, but the plaintiff's furniture so interfered, with what they desired to do that Hammond, the agent for Mead & Coe, without consultation with them, or information to them of the situation, decided to put the plaintiff's furniture out, and proceeded so to do. He, and those acting with him, testified that while the plaintiff objected to their doing so and stated that she had meant to have been out before and would go very shortly, she finally told Mr. Hammond that he could do as he thought best. So far as appears, before Parker, Mead or Coe knew anything of what had been done in the way of moving the plaintiff's furniture, she had voluntarily taken out the furniture and her belongings in the room which was not disturbed by Hammond and moved it with herself to another flat."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

Shortly after the train left the station, it was stopped on the tracks and its power was turned off. 1 1/2 hours after the train initially came to a stop on the tracks, an announcement was made that the passengers in Torf's car should evacuate the train by exiting the doors. There were no CTA employees in Torf's car to help passengers evacuate and no announcement was made as to whether power was running through the tracks. Instead, one of the passengers in Torf's car opened the doors and the passengers evacuated the train by either jumping from the car to the gravel beside the tracks below or by sitting down on the edge of the car and then jumping from the train. There was a significant drop from the train's floor to the gravel below. Torf waited until all the other passengers in her car had left the train before she attempted to evacuate because she knew that she would be slow due to a problem with her knee. Torf attempted to evacuate by sitting down at the exit door of the car in order to lower herself down more gradually. As Torf was attempting to sit down, someone 'pushed down on [her] shoulders' and moved his body around her and then jumped off the train. The push from this person forced Torf into a sitting position and she used her hands to break her fall. Another person then put his or her hands on Torf's back and 'pushed' her from behind, causing Torf to fall off the train. As a result of the incident, Torf experienced pain in her lower back, hip, and hands. Torf lost some functionality in her right hand and missed approximately two weeks of work.

Upon learning of the sewer's presence, plaintiff demanded that defendant remove it, but defendant refused. Plaintiff then filed the instant complaint. The storm sewer in question is part of a drainage district which, according to defendant, services thousands of residents and the city's business district. Defendant has maintained that the sewer was installed in 1927 with the consent of the property owner at the time. In support of this claim, defendant relies on newspaper articles describing the city park district's approval of a contract for construction of a storm sewer in the vicinity in that year, minutes of a July 1927 city council meeting, and deposition testimony by a current city employee. [Adapted from excluded testimony:] the property owner at the time the sewer was laid consented to its placement because the owner was a construction company which performed the installation work. The minutes of a July 6, 1927, Crystal Lake city council meeting indicate that a motion was carried 'that the Crystal Lake Park District be credited with $ 800 worth of city water for which the said Crystal Lake Park District shall connect the city storm sewer with the drain now being laid across the Lake Development Co's [sic] property to the outlet.'

Along the river is a massive pumphouse, built in the 1950's, that defendant uses to extract large amounts of water from the river for use in its foundry, located approximately one-half mile south of the river. To operate the pumps, overhead electrical lines enter the pumphouse from the south and connect to several electrical transformers located in an enclosed, elevated balcony. The pumps do not run constantly, but only when the water level of the reservoir drops to a certain point. The balcony area, located on the south side of the pumphouse, is almost 10 feet off the ground and is surrounded by a steel shroud. This second-story balcony contains three electrical transformers which sit on an elevated platform approximately three feet above the balcony floor, which is constructed of wooden slats with gaps between them. These transformers, and several bare wires that feed into them, carry approximately 4,160 volts of electricity. The balcony, which extends out from the pumphouse, is enclosed by four walls, but only has a partial roof. Directly beneath the balcony is a locked door, leading to a room in the pumphouse, in which a ladder is kept. On occasion, defendant's employees use this ladder to gain access to the balcony by way of an overhead gap, 12 by 20 inches wide, located in the floor of the balcony. In the 35 years since the pumphouse was built, no electrical contact accidents have occurred except for the incident in the present case. Evidence presented at trial showed that people occasionally trespassed in the general vicinity of the pumphouse, but no evidence showed that defendant had knowledge of any previous attempts by a trespasser to scale the pumphouse's wall and crawl through the gap in the floor of the balcony. Several of defendant's security officers testified at trial that whenever they discovered a trespasser on any portion of defendant's property, they promptly told the individual to leave the premises. At the time of plaintiff's accident, the pumphouse did not have any warning signs, the paint on the pumphouse was peeling, and the fences surrounding the pumphouse on the river side had fallen into disrepair. In earlier years, warning signs had been posted on the fence gate, the pumphouse, and near the river's edge. At trial, plaintiff made much of the issue that the condition of the pumphouse and its surrounding area violated the National Electric Code and the National Electrical Safety Code. On June 13, 1984, plaintiff (then 20 years old) and Charles Boswell (then 19 years old) began a canoe trip down the Vermilion River. They canoed the river until nightfall, when they stopped to camp under a railroad trestle that crossed the river. The next morning, plaintiff and Boswell decided to explore some of the river they had passed the night before. The day was sunny. Their first stop was the pumphouse. The two paddled their canoe to the river bank and docked alongside a platform at the base of the pumphouse. Plaintiff and Boswell admitted at trial that they were trespassers and did not have defendant's permission to enter the property. Neither had seen the pumphouse before and did not know what it was. They thought it was an old abandoned structure. As soon as they docked, plaintiff got out of the canoe and quickly ran up some stairs located along the east side of the pumphouse. When Boswell reached the top of the stairs, plaintiff was already on the roof of the pumphouse. After jumping off the roof, plaintiff saw the lock on the pumphouse door and a fence with a closed and locked double gate, topped with barbed wire, in front of the pumphouse. A dirt road led southward from the gate. Neither plaintiff nor Boswell tried to open the gate or cross the fence. Plaintiff testified at trial that they thought they were on the outside looking in. Plaintiff then looked up through the gap in the balcony floor. He testified that, from below, the balcony was dark except for rays of light that came in through the partial roof. Plaintiff testified that he climbed up into the balcony to see what was there because he was curious. Plaintiff gained access to the balcony by scaling a ninefoot wall with the aid of a pipe and some eyebolts sticking out of the wall. He then crawled through the 12- by 20-inch gap in the floor of the balcony and circumvented a ledge sticking out 8 to 10 inches from the top of the wall. After climbing into the balcony, plaintiff grabbed a live electrical wire in order to pull himself up. The wire on which plaintiff severely injured his hand was approximately 13 feet off the ground. Plaintiff testified that before the accident he saw barrels and cables in the balcony, although his visibility was poor. Plaintiff admitted that he had previously seen transformers on utility poles, but he had never heard of them referred to as transformers. Plaintiff and Boswell testified that they did not see the three overhead transmission lines coming from the hill to the south, nor did they hear any noises coming from the balcony area. After the accident, Boswell helped plaintiff climb down from the balcony. The two walked down the stairs to the canoe, paddled the river a short distance, and obtained a ride to the hospital. Plaintiff spent several painful weeks in the hospital and had a series of operations on his hand. As a result of the accident, plaintiff's hand is disfigured. He lost the little finger of his right hand and some dexterity in his other fingers. Also, his hand is not as strong as it was before the accident."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

They took from the schoolhouse a bell, and provided themselves with bells, pans, plowshares, revolvers, and a shotgun, and other implements for making a noise. They reached Hirsch's home, in a body, between 9 and 10 o'clock. There, with a shotgun, revolvers, plowshares, sleigh bells, dinner bells, etc., they approached near the house, where the guns and pistols were discharged, and the other instruments were put in motion, and all the noise was made which they could make with such instruments. Considerable excitement and commotion were created in the house among the women. The hired man came to the gate of the yard, and asked them not to fire off firearms, as it would frighten the horses of the guests there hitched.

Upon completing a job at ComEd's Dresden plant in 1981, Hennessy received what is known as an 'exit whole body count' and several repeat counts, and was subsequently informed by a technician that he had an internal contamination of Cobalt-60. Hennessy asked questions of Dresden workers and of Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials regarding the effects of the internal contamination. He specifically spoke with the NRC on-site inspector, Tom Tongue, who told him not to worry about the internal contamination and indicated that the level was not dangerous or potentially harmful. In a phone conversation, an NRC official in Washington told Hennessy the same thing. None of these individuals, or anyone else, ever told him that he would have any ill effects physically as a result of the contamination. ComEd's health physicists told him that the contamination would ultimately leave his body through bodily secretions. The training course Hennessy took before working at Dresden did not inform him of the possibility of internal exposure. Hennessy subsequently began to worry about the effects of the contamination based on having 'read articles and things about cobalt, what it does to you.' Hennessy has not identified any of the articles he claims to have read that gave rise to his worry. He also became concerned about the potential for contaminating his wife. He asked the various technicians and NRC officials whether he could contaminate his wife through sexual intercourse, but they did not know the answer. He claims that as a result of this, he developed a drinking problem and for a period of up to one year and a half he stopped having intercourse with his wife. The first time that Hennessy saw a doctor after the incident was on January 18, 1982, nine months after he learned of the internal contamination. On that date, Hennessy visited his family doctor, Dr. John Siebert, complaining of upper abdominal and lower chest discomfort. Hennessy also expressed general concerns to the doctor about his radiation exposure at work, but did not specifically discuss the incident of internal exposure. During the examination, Dr. Siebert diagnosed Hennessy as having a duodenal ulcer and treated Hennessy with medication. Over one year later, in early 1983, Hennessy next saw Dr. Alvin Tarlov on the advise of his counsel. Dr. Tarlov examined Hennessy and conducted several tests which included a chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function test. Hennessy claims he never learned of the results from those tests and never saw Dr. Tarlov again. All of the test results were normal. Four years later, on April 6, 1987, Hennessy returned to Dr. Siebert. Hennessy again complained of abdominal pain. Dr. Siebert recommended a gastroscopy due to the persistence of the ulcer in spite of the medication. A gastrologist, Dr. James Vandermeer, conducted the gastroscopy and confirmed the presence of a duodenal ulcer. At his deposition on June 6, 1990, Dr. Siebert opined that the ulcer discovered in 1987 was a recurrence of the ulcer he found in 1982. He concluded, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Hennessy's ulcer was caused by stress. Based on the one instance of Hennessy complaining generally about radiation exposure eight years earlier in 1982, Dr. Siebert concluded that the source of Hennessy's stress was his concern about radiation exposure at work. Dr. Siebert explained the basis for that conclusion as follows: 'I think radiation exposure is a real threat to somebody. It would be to me because probably, I don't think people know a lot about radiation exposure and a fear about the unknown is a real life thing. I think it was grinding on him is what I am trying to say.' Hennessy's internal 50-year committed dose of 24 millirem exposure was very small and there is no possibility of adverse biological effects from such an exposure. Dr. Saenger concluded that Hennessy has suffered no acute health effects and has a zero percent chance of an increased risk of cancer or of any long term adverse health effects as a result of his internal Cobalt-60 contamination."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Battery"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

He stated that he wrote to [the owner at the time,] Mrs. Hayward and asked permission to lay a main across a field to Hickory street; that in said letter be explained to her that the main would be laid at least two or two and onehalf feet below the surface of the ground and would not interfere in any way with the cultivation of the fields; that he received a reply from Mrs. Hayward [and] that she told him it would be all right to lay the main; that after receiving her letter the People's Gas Company proceeded to lay the main across the Hayward field. Mrs. Hayward who it is claimed granted the license had been dead many years before plaintiff acquired title to the premises. The defendant company purchased the People's Gas Company and all its rights and franchises in 1917.

Shortly after the train left the station, it was stopped on the tracks and its power was turned off. 1 1/2 hours after the train initially came to a stop on the tracks, an announcement was made that the passengers in Torf's car should evacuate the train by exiting the doors. There were no CTA employees in Torf's car to help passengers evacuate and no announcement was made as to whether power was running through the tracks. Instead, one of the passengers in Torf's car opened the doors and the passengers evacuated the train by either jumping from the car to the gravel beside the tracks below or by sitting down on the edge of the car and then jumping from the train. There was a significant drop from the train's floor to the gravel below. Torf waited until all the other passengers in her car had left the train before she attempted to evacuate because she knew that she would be slow due to a problem with her knee.

Plaintiff, who currently resides in Phoenix, Arizona, previously lived at the Kristine Lane residence with his now-ex-wife, Karen Shepard, who was at times relevant to this case known as Karen Jackson. On or about April 2, 2001, Karen Jackson borrowed $380,000 from EquiFirst Corporation to purchase the Kristine Lane residence. As security for the loan, Karen Jackson executed a mortgage in favor of EquiFirst Corporation. The mortgage document also contains Plaintiff's signature. However, every time it appears, it is above the wording, 'Gregory Jackson, spouse of Karen Jackson, is signing this mortgage solely to waive any and all homestead rights.' Plaintiff concedes that he 'was not on the legal title to the property,' but maintains that he simply signed the documents that he was required to sign to buy the home with his then-wife. Plaintiff also testified that he made monetary contributions to live in the home, and that he was actively involved in attempting to secure a loan modification. The mortgage was recorded with the Cook County recorder on April 13, 2001. The mortgage eventually was assigned to Defendant BONY, a mortgage lender. BONY recorded the mortgage on December 1, 2008. Defendant Litton acted as the mortgage servicing company. BONY and Litton concede in their brief that Litton was 'the servicer and attorney-in-fact for BONY.' In 2005 or 2006, Karen Jackson vacated the Kristine Lane residence and moved to Texas. Plaintiff continued to reside in the Kristine Lane residence during the couple's separation and ensuing divorce. Plaintiff did not have a lease to the home. He testified, however, that he was awarded the Kristine Lane residence pursuant to a court order issued in his divorce proceedings. Plaintiff similarly states in his responses to Defendants' statements of facts that he 'received the rights to the Residence as part of the divorce settlement.' After the divorce was finalized, at some point in early-to-mid 2009, Plaintiff leased a condominium in Arizona and began splitting his time between Arizona and the Kristine Lane residence as part of a 'long-term move' pursuant to which he would 'go a week, come back two weeks, whatever.' Until that time, however, Plaintiff lived exclusively in the Kristine Lane home. It is undisputed that Karen Jackson defaulted under the terms of her Note and Mortgage. On July 11, 2008, BONY and/or Litton 2 filed a foreclosure action in the Circuit Court of Cook County. Plaintiff and Karen Jackson were both named as defendants. In December 2008, BONY obtained a foreclosure judgment against Karen Jackson. The Kristine Lane residence was sold at a foreclosure sale in August 2009. Prior to the sale, Plaintiff communicated with Litton to try to obtain a loan modification. Plaintiff went to Arizona in June 2009. Plaintiff claims that the Kristine Lane residence was 'secure' when he left and that 'all of his personal possessions were in the home.' The deposition testimony that he cites in support of these contentions merely states that the house was 'okay' and 'in perfect condition' when he left, and that his personal items were still there. Plaintiff did not return to the home at any point between June and late September 2009. Plaintiff testified that he 'never allowed anybody else in the property while [he was] gone.' In August 2009, Defendant Litton retained Realty Executives Target to prepare the Kristine Lane property for listing. Realty Executives would submit bids for various tasks, which Litton would approve. Realty Executives Target dispatched Patrick Sawaska, owner of Amazing Grass, to Kristine Lane to check the occupancy status and provide property maintenance services. It is undisputed that Sawaska went to the Kristine Lane residence on August 21, 2009. Sawaska testified that he entered the home through an unlocked sliding glass door. Sawaska observed that the home contained a significant amount of personal property. Sawaska also noted that the home's basement was flooded and that the railing leading downstairs was moldy. Sawaska re-keyed the doors to the Kristine Lane residence and placed a lockbox containing the new key on the front door. Sawaska used the code 'LIT' on the lockbox because the home was a Litton property. Sawaska testified that, although he did not remember doing so in this particular case, he typically placed a sign saying Realty Executives in the front yard of homes that he re-keyed. Two days later, on August 23, 2009, Sawaska returned to the Kristine Lane home to take photographs of the personal items inside. When he arrived, he noticed that the front door knob had been broken off. Sawaska entered the home and observed that many of the personal belongings were gone, including the TVs, couches, and even bed linens. Id. While Sawaska was at the property, a neighbor called the police. The police arrived and spoke to Sawaska, who told them that someone had been there and stolen some items. Sawaska took some photographs of the property, re-keyed it again, and placed a new lockbox on the front door before leaving. The police were called to the Kristine Lane residence again on August 24, 2009. Officer David Jackson conducted a premises exam and gained entry to the home through an unlocked and open back door. Officer Jackson walked through the home and noted that a washing machine, dryer, and bedroom set were present. He also observed that no one was in the home and that the basement was flooded and moldy. Officer Jackson did not see anything suggesting that Defendant Safeguard Properties, a field service provider that provides property preservation services to the mortgage industry, had been in the home. Officer Jackson locked the rear door from the inside and locked the front door on his way out. Later that same day, at 11:29 p.m., the police were called to the Kristine Lane residence a third time. Officer Andrew Derewonko went to the property and observed someone changing the locks on the home. The identity of this individual is unclear from the record, though Officer Derewonko testified that the man told him that he was working for the bank. Officer Derewonko entered the home. He observed that there was no furniture and that the basement smelled moldy. Officer Derewonko testified that he left before the individual had completed the re-keying. On September 15, 2009, Defendant Safeguard issued a work order for the Kristine Lane residence to S & J Foreclosure Cleanup Incorporated ('S & J'), a business owned by Steven Clausell. Safeguard and Litton were parties to a Master Services Agreement, pursuant to which Safeguard agreed to provide field services such as occupancy inspections, maintenance, and preservation services to Litton on certain properties. Safeguard periodically had performed occupancy inspections for Litton on the Kristine Lane residence since February 2002. Plaintiff and Safeguard agree that the Kristine Lane property was on Safeguard's inventory list of properties. Plaintiff contends, however, that the work order was issued incorrectly due to an internal communication breakdown at Safeguard. Plaintiff contends that Litton did not order the specific winterization services that S & J was dispatched to perform. Safeguard characterizes S & J as an independent contractor; Plaintiff disputes this characterization. Plaintiff asserts that Safeguard's 'vendors,' a term that Safeguard also uses to describe entities like S & J, are 'anything but independent.' In Plaintiff's view, Safeguard furnished its vendors with 'detailed work orders with very specific tasks to perform within a very specified time.' Plaintiff also points to Safeguard's 66-page policies and procedures manual, which outlines procedures for performing various property perseveration tasks, as evidence of the control that Defendant Safeguard exerted over its vendors. See id. Safeguard for its part does not dispute that it provides its vendors with a policies and procedures manual and expects them to follow it. Safeguard also concedes that it 'has very specific photo requirements for its vendors' that are 'driven by the mortgage company client or by Safeguard,' and that its vendors are subject to a probationary period. The parties agree that Safeguard furnished S & J a 1099 federal tax form at the end of 2009. They also agree that S & J provided its own equipment and crew of workers. Clausell of S & J went to the Kristine Lane residence on September 16, 2009 to determine what he would need to do to complete the work order. Clausell entered the home and noted that there was some personal property inside. Clausell returned to the Kristine Lane residence on September 17, 2009 to perform the winterization that Safeguard had ordered on September 15. On September 18, 2009, Clausell reported to Safeguard that he had completed the work and that the residence was secure when he arrived and was secured by him at his departure. Clausell also submitted a bid to Safeguard to remove the personal property in the home, including the 'waterlogged' property in the flooded basement. Safeguard did not instruct or request that Clausell remove any personal property from the home, and Clausell testified that neither he nor anyone associated with S & J actually removed any property from the home. Clausell did not return to the Kristine Lane residence after he completed the winterization work order on September 17, 2009. At midnight on September 18, 2009, Officer Jackson of the Richton Park Police Department received a call reporting the presence of a U-Haul trailer at the Kristine Lane residence. Officer Jackson stopped the U-Haul trailer, which contained a washing machine, dryer, and table and chairs. The driver of the U-Haul trailer told Officer Jackson that his name was Charmane Powells, that he worked for a company called Cyprexx, and that his girlfriend, Sandra Salinas, had given him permission to remove a washing machine and dryer from the Kristine Lane residence. Salinas subsequently arrived on the scene and told Officer Jackson that her uncle, William Jackson, had given her permission to remove the washing machine and dryer and, moreover, had given her the code to the lockbox on the front door. There is no dispute that Powells, Salinas, and William Jackson were not employees, agents, or independent contractors of Safeguard. Plaintiff and Safeguard further agree that Safeguard did not instruct or authorize Powells, Salinas, or William Jackson to enter the Kristine Lane residence or to remove the washing machine and dryer. Later in the day on September 18, 2009, Sawaska returned to the Kristine Lane residence to complete additional work. It is unclear what the work was, or which, if any, of the Defendants directed Sawaska to return. Sawaska noticed that washing machine, dryer, and table were missing from the residence. When Plaintiff returned to the Kristine Lane residence approximately a week later, he discovered for the first time that the locks had been changed. Plaintiff also saw a Safeguard sticker on the front door. Although Plaintiff asserts that the sticker announced that Safeguard 'had been on the premises on behalf of the lender and Litton,' his deposition testimony unequivocally states that the sticker did not refer to Litton or BONY. Plaintiff contacted Safeguard upon seeing the sign on the door. Plaintiff also spoke with Litton, which gave him the code to open the lockbox after he provided the loan number. Plaintiff testified that he did not get the code from Litton until Monday, September 28, 2009. After using the code to open the lockbox, Plaintiff entered the house, discovered that his personal property was missing, and called the Richton Park police. The responding officer told Plaintiff that he had been called to the residence before, and that the individual at the residence on that day said he was there on behalf of a mortgage company and provided documentation to the officer. Approximately one month later, on October 28, 2009, the Cook County Circuit Court entered an order confirming the foreclosure sale. The order provided that 'the successful bidder, any insurers, investors, and agents of the Plaintiff, are entitled to and shall have possession of the subject property as of a date 30 days after entry of this order, without further Order of the Court.' Plaintiff testified that he spoke with Litton's lawyers at some point, and that the lawyers told him that he had until December 1, 2009 to vacate the property."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

John Castoro is the Chief Executive Officer and owns approximately 50% of Custom Aluminum's stock. Steven Dillett, as President, is responsible for overall profitability and long-term positioning structure for the company. In 1994, Plaintiff James Marks was hired as a general foreman. Five years later, he was promoted to Plant Manager and held that position until his termination on October 12, 2005. Marks and Castoro socialized outside of work, played video golf together, and exchanged gifts. At work, they frequently took long lunches together, accompanied by Patrick Breslin, personal assistant to John Castoro. Marks and John Castoro had frequent physical interactions; physical violence inflicted upon Marks despite his objections [which he tolerated] out of fear for his job. Castoro owns knives, brought them to work, and on one occasion used a knife to shave the hair off Marks' and Breslin's arms. Castoro also kept a gun in his office because he feared that terminated employees might return. Castoro frequently brought his Rottweiler to work, an animal that terrified several employees at Custom Aluminum. On July 25, 2005, Marks was injured at work. Marks was out of work from August 30 or 31 until September 19, 2005. The pain from this injury was so severe that Marks was admitted to the hospital and treated with 'a lot of painkillers.' When he returned to work, he was restricted from lifting using the right side of his body and had to attend physical therapy three to four days per week, for about two hours per day beginning at 1 or 1:30 p.m. Marks complained frequently to other employees about the severe pain he suffered. His coworker, Elizabeth Ayala, noted that he looked like he was in pain constantly. Marks also informed Castoro that Castoro could no longer hit him because of the injury. Marks complained at least once to Steve Dillett about Castoro hitting him, but Dillett said nothing to either Marks or Castoro. Upon Marks' return, Castoro made comments to Marks such as 'you've got a bad flipper,' 'you're no longer fun' 'you're no good to me,' and 'I won't have my lunch buddy anymore.' Castoro described Marks as 'damaged goods,' [which made] Marks think that his job was on the line over his going to therapy. On Friday, October 7, 2005, John Castoro hit Marks on his uninjured arm twice. The first time, the blow hurt Marks so badly that he went down to his knees in pain, and asked Castoro to stop hitting him. The second time Castoro hit him, Marks responded by slapping Castoro on the head - an action Castoro testified he understood to mean that Marks didn't want Castoro to hit him anymore. Marks apologized to Castoro for hitting him. On Monday morning, October 10, Castoro entered Marks' office where Marks was discussing plans for the Christmas party with Ayala. Castoro 'greeted' Marks by 'slapping' his left (uninjured) arm. Marks responded by swearing at Castoro and throwing a pen. Marks says threw the pen on his desk and the pen ricocheted to hit Castoro. Castoro responded by telling Marks to leave; he also said Marks should take some time off and suggested that he might not need to come back at all. Castoro had the authority to fire employees and had done so in the past by sending the employee home in the middle of the day. Accordingly, Marks left, believing that he had been fired. Shortly thereafter, Castoro was advised that the company had received a call from 'an insurance person, maybe a workers' compensation person' who inquired as to Marks' employment status, having learned that Marks was terminated. Castoro then shut off Marks' company cell phone service and changed the locks on his office door."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Battery"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

Do not explain."}, {"role": "system", "content": "Since June 9, 1925, plaintiffs Saverio Ariola and Susanna Ariola were owners in joint tenancy of the property at 818 N. Twenty-third Avenue, Melrose Park, which was improved with a two-story house occupied by them and their children, the other plaintiffs herein, as a family home. The Ariola property fronts on Twenty-third Avenue and extends west for a distance of approximately 50 feet along Iowa Street on the north, and for 51 feet along Lake Street on the south. Immediately to the west of the Ariola property is the Nigro property, held in joint tenancy by defendants. This property, known as 2305 Lake Street, fronts on Lake Street, and extends along that street for some 77 feet 3 1/2 inches, and along Iowa Street on the north for some 75 feet 1 3/4 inches. The property was improved with a one-story building, until October, 1948, when defendants commenced construction of an addition. According to the testimony of defendants' mason contractor, he excavated right up to plaintiffs' building foundation, put in forms only on one side and poured concrete flush against plaintiffs' foundation, so that the east part of defendants' foundation is flush with the west part of plaintiffs' building. Special surveys made at plaintiffs' request by registered surveyors before defendants' brick work was superimposed, indicated that defendants' foundation encroached upon plaintiffs' property to the extent of 1 inch at the northeast corner of defendants' foundation and some 2 3/8 inches at the southeast corner of the foundation. Plaintiffs thereupon notified defendants of the encroachment and requested them to discontinue construction. Notice was also given by plaintiffs' attorney to defendant Nigro and to his attorney. Nevertheless, defendants proceeded with the construction of the two-story brick addition, which according to plaintiffs' surveys also encroached to the same extent above ground level. Defendants, however, deny any such encroachment, and their mason contractor testified that the village markers were followed, and that plaintiffs' foundation was irregular and encroached on defendants' property. It appears further from defendant Daniel Nigro's testimony as an adverse witness that before construction began he had notified plaintiffs that defendants would occupy all of their property, and that it would be necessary for plaintiffs to remove their projecting gutters and downspouts along the west wall. The evidence is controverted as to the length of time plaintiffs' gutters and downspouts projected from plaintiff's west wall. On plaintiffs' behalf, their original builder and other witnesses testified that the gutters and downspouts were originally installed along the west wall in 1925, when the house was built, and have remained there since that time. On defendants' behalf, his former partner testified that the gutters were not there in 1945, that there had been gutters on the south wall, as suggested by a photograph showing some discoloration on the south wall, possibly from rain gutters; and the brother of defendants' attorney stated that as plaintiffs' agent he had secured permission from defendants to install the gutters about a year and onehalf before they were torn down. However, a plat of survey, introduced by defendants, and dated June 7, 1941, contained the notation, 'downspouts and gutters project 6' west of line.' In any event, plaintiffs refused to remove the gutters, and, according to defendants' admission and the testimony of their builder, defendants ordered that they be torn down and that the construction of the building proceed as planned. The evidence further shows that upon plaintiffs' refusal to pay half the cost of installing a 'saddle' type drainage installation, defendants, unbeknown to plaintiffs, installed a tar paper flashing between the east wall of the new building and the west wall of plaintiffs' home, to prevent drainage of rain water and melting snow between the two buildings. This flashing, according to the testimony of both plaintiffs' and defendants' witnesses, was not very effective and caused the accumulation of water along the west wall of the Ariola building, with resulting seepage and rotting of the plaster flashing on the inside of plaintiffs' wall and deterioration of the mortar joints between the bricks. Plaintiffs offered evidence that such seepage did not occur prior to 1948. Upon discovery of the tar paper flashing in 1951, some two years after it was installed, plaintiff Ariola's son kicked a hole in it in order to permit the water to drain off. His testimony as to the accumulation of several inches of water at the west end of the roof was corroborated by the commercial photographer who saw the premises in 1951."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

On his way home, Lee entered a CTA right-ofway at the intersection of Kedzie Avenue and the Ravenswood railway line in Chicago, apparently, in order to urinate. The right-of-way was posted with signs, placed on a utility shed and on sawhorses at each side of the tracks, warning 'Danger,' 'Keep Out,' and 'Electric Current.' Parallel to the tracks and approximately 6 1/2 feet from the sidewalk lay a streetlevel third rail. The purpose of the rail, which carried 600 volts of electricity, was to supply power to trains as they passed through the street-level crossing. The CTA had laid uneven-edged boards, about six inches apart, called 'jaws' on its right-of-way next to the sidewalk in order to make pedestrians aware that they were not meant to walk in that area. The uneven surface of the boards, also known as 'cattle boards,' makes it impossible for cattle and difficult for persons to walk atop them. The 'jaws' at Kedzie Avenue extended between the end of the third rail and the sidewalk and were also placed on either side of the rail and between the tracks. Lee, whose blood-alcohol level of 0.341 placed him in the 'stupor' classification of intoxication, made contact with the third rail and suffered fatal injuries. Lee was neither permitted nor invited to be on the Kedzie Avenue CTA tracks at the time of his death. Plaintiff did not rebut this testimony. Wolgemuth further testified that there are 19 grade, or street-level, crossings on the CTA transit lines where trains are powered by a third rail. At two of the grade crossings, located at Maple and Isabella Streets in Wilmette, the CTA installed safety measures consisting of automatic chain link fence-type gates across the track when the line was converted from overhead to third rail power in 1973. Before installing the 'jaws' trespass system on the Ravenswood line in 1976, the CTA considered three alternative protective systems: gates such as those at the Wilmette grade crossings, which would remain closed except when a train was in the station; boards, which would cover the third rail on all but the train side; and catenary lines, which would carry the electric current overhead. [There were] 10 prior accidents which occurred between 1948 and 1975 on the 3.2-mile segment of track where the CTA's third rail runs at grade level. One of the accidents occurred at the Ravenswood/Kedzie crossing in 1974, when a youth fell from a fence he was scaling onto the rail. The CTA had notice of the accidents on that section of its line prior to 1977. There were no accidents on the section between July 1976, when it installed the 'jaws,' and October 1977, when Lee was electrocuted. The segment of track in question is the only one in the United States or Canada where an electrically charged grade-level third rail is unguarded, uncovered or unfenced."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

The defendant below, appellee here, introduced in evidence the declaration, pleas, instructions, verdict, judgment, and other proceedings in a certain trespass suit, brought to the September term, 1902, of said court by the present appellant, Herschbach, against the present appellee, Cohen. In the trespass suit the declaration charged that the defendant, Cohen, [***3] cut and destroyed the timber of the plaintiff of the value of $500.00, 'then growing and being in and upon certain lands of the plaintiff there situate, being part of surveys 222 and 223, * * * and took and carried away the said * * * timber and converted and disposed of the same to his own use,' etc. To the declaration in the trespass suit two pleas were filed, one, a plea of not guilty, and the other, a plea of liberum tenementum. In the latter plea it was set up, 'that the close in the said declaration mentioned, and in which, etc., now is and at the time when, etc., was the close, soil and freehold of the defendant.' The instructions in the trespass suit instructed the jury as to the boundary line between adjoining owners on the island and mainland, and as to the location of the slough, claimed to be the boundary line between the two tracts, and as to its change of position by reason of the change in the bed or current of the river. The trial in the trespass suit was before a jury, and the jury therein returned a verdict on September 15, 1902, finding the defendant therein, the present appellee, [guilty]. Motion for a new trial in the trespass suit was overruled, and judgment [***4] was rendered in favor of [plaintiff] on the verdict and against the plaintiff therein, the present appellant, for costs of suit. Upon the trial below of the present ejectment suit, the following stipulation was made between the parties: 'It is admitted that the land, sued for in this case, is the same land that was involved in an action in trespass commenced by Mr. Herschbach, the plaintiff, against Cohen, the defendant, which was finally disposed of at the September term, 1902, of this court; it is agreed that, when all the evidence is in on this question of former adjudication, if the court holds that the plea of former adjudication is not a defense in this suit, then judgment shall pass for the plaintiff, with right to a new trial according to the statute, or appeal if desired.' It is not denied on the part of the appellee that the appellant herein is the owner of the said surveys numbered 222 and 223; and it is not denied, on the part of the appellant, that the appellee is the owner of said island, lying west of the western boundary of said surveys. It was proven that, upon the trial of the trespass suit, 'both plaintiff and defendant introduced evidence to locate the boundaries [***5] of the two claims and surveys, numbered 222 and 223, and to locate the slough, as it was at the time the government surveyed these surveys, and to locate it, as it was at the time of the trial of that suit; and that the object of the evidence was to ascertain whether the timber cut was cut on the land of the plaintiff, or of the defendant, in that cause; that the plaintiff and defendant in that suit were respectively the plaintiff and defendant in this suit; that the plaintiff made preliminary proof of the fact, that the timber was cut, and that it was cut on the land between the two sloughs, shown on 'Exhibit A' introduced in this case, which is the same plat used in that case; that the defendant did not deny the cutting of the timber, but that there was some little evidence as to the value of the timber cut; that the great bulk of the evidence of numerous witnesses was as to where that slough was at the time of the government survey, and where it was at the time of the trial of the case, plaintiff contending that it never had moved, and defendant contending that it had moved to the point 'A' on exhibits 1 and 2.' The land, here in controversy, is 18.24 acres lying between two sloughs, [***6] or arms of the Mississippi river, appellant contending that his land extended as far as the westernmost slough called in the evidence the 'original slough,' and appellee claiming that appellant's land only extended as far as the easternmost of the two sloughs, marked '1-2,' the land between the two being 18.24 acres."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

When it was in operation, the Skokie MGP employed a process for enhancing the caloric value of manufactured gas using oil and water gas. This manufacturing process left behind dense, oily waste materials that were stored in above-ground tanks at the Skokie MGP's site. Some MG Waste Oils also condensed along the inside of the pipelines comprised in the Skokie MGP's distribution infrastructure, which was used to transport manufactured gas through Evanston. The Skokie MGP ceased operations in the early 1950s. Since that time, according to Plaintiff, MG Waste Oils have leaked out of the Skokie MGP's aboveground tanks and distribution pipelines into the soil and groundwater at James Park, Dawes Elementary School, Levy Senior Center, and surrounding properties in Evanston. Plaintiff refers to these properties as the 'Impacted Area.' The complaint describes the Impacted Area as 'generally bounded by Oakton Street to [the] north, Dodge Avenue to the east, Mulford Street on the south and the North Shore Canal on the west.' Plaintiff alleges that the released MG Waste Oils present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment in two ways. First, released MG Waste Oils have coated and penetrated the Dodge Avenue Water Line, which runs along the eastern boundary of the Impacted Area and conveys potable water to local residents. MG Waste Oils coating the Dodge Avenue Water Line have contaminated Evanston's drinking water and also threaten future contamination. Second, as MG Waste Oils have degraded in the soil, groundwater, and bedrock over time, they have released methane gas as a byproduct. Methane gas has been found at high pressure and concentration within the Impacted Area. And when methane is present at a sufficiently high pressure and concentration in a given area, it can be easily ignited, resulting in an explosion. The methane released from MG Waste Oils first came to Plaintiff's attention in 2012. Around that time, MG Waste Oils and methane were found during an investigation of an area 1,000 feet southwest of James Park. When methane was subsequently detected in James Park itself, Plaintiff initially suspected that it might have originated from a decades-old landfill beneath the park. But Plaintiff later determined that gas pipelines were the methane's more likely source based on concentration levels. In May 2014, Plaintiff informed Nicor that methane had been detected at James Park and asked Nicor to provide documentation regarding distribution pipelines it operated in the park's vicinity. Nicor refused to cooperate with Plaintiff's request for information. Defendants knew or should have known no later than 2015 that MG Waste Oils had penetrated the Dodge Avenue Water Line."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Positive"}

He claimed that the food on the tray was detrimental to his renal condition and his hypertension. The officers informed him that they were ordered to provide the plaintiff with the diet tray. He wrote to Dr. Sood and asked the doctor to take him off the diet because he thought his diet should be closely monitored by a dietitian. The guards continued to provide the plaintiff with dietary trays. The plaintiff refused to eat the meals. He told nurse Peiler that he was not eating because the staff refused to feed him. During that same month, the correctional officers informed the plaintiff that he had been assigned a cellmate and would have to move. The plaintiff refused to move into a shared cell, claiming that he was contagious. A staff nurse advised the plaintiff that he could only infect his cellmate if they engaged in sexual intercourse or shared intravenous drug needles."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Battery"}], "ideal": "Negative"}

The record is not exact regarding the nature and extent of Mogo's business, but it involves the sale of computer equipment. In 1996, Mogo had approximately 25 employees and, at all relevant times, Wu was not merely the president but also the principal, if not the sole, shareholder of the corporation. Bernard did not receive a written description of his duties but rather worked on matters by way of direct assignment from Wu. On December 23, 1992, Bernard and Mogo executed a written employment contract. The contract, which was drawn up on Mogo stationary and signed by Bernard and Wu contained the following terms: 'We/I agree to the following for Bernard A. Livers, I. Employment for a minimum of 4 years. II. 15% of the net profit from Mogo Inc. to be paid on a Quarterly basis as long as under [sic] Bernard A. Livers is under Mogo Inc. employment. III. If Mogo Inc. sells out with in 4 years, Bernard A. Livers will get a buy-out suitable to both parties. IV. After 4 years if our client base has reached four thousand, Bernard A. Livers will be entitled to 5% ownership of Mogo Inc.' Bernard's starting salary was $20,000.00 per annum plus commissions, but, by the date of the employment contract, his salary had increased to $43,333.00 per annum. During the course of his employment, Bernard was paid additional sums in response to specific requests: an unspecified sum with respect to the purchase of a home, $7,000.00 relating to the payment of taxes and $1,000.00 to assist in the funding of a vacation. Mogo's fortunes floundered over the next few years. It suffered a net loss every year, with the exception of 1994, when it had a net income of $60,013.00. Sometime in 1995, a decision was made to terminate the employment of a number of employees, including Bernard. On April 11, 1996, approximately eight months prior to the end of his four-year employment term, Bernard was discharged by Mogo. At the time of his discharge, Bernard was earning an annual salary of $60,000.00. Mogo subsequently offered to reemploy him as an independent contractor, to be paid solely on a commission basis, but Bernard rejected the offer. As regards the other terms of the employment contract, the record does not establish facts that would trigger an entitlement to a buy-out or to a 5% interest in Mogo. Mogo did not sell out within the four year term and, additionally, Mogo's client base did not reach even half the number required to create the 5% interest for Bernard. However, it is clear that Mogo failed to provide Bernard with an accounting of net profits and losses in respect of any quarter. While Mogo concedes that it did have a net profit of $60,013.00 in 1994, it does not dispute that it failed to pay Bernard any sum as a percentage of net profit. Mogo also failed to reimburse Bernard $505.28 in respect of a business trip to Arizona which he undertook on behalf of Mogo. After his separation from Mogo, Bernard remained in possession of his company car, which was owned by Mogo. Bernard offered to return the car, but only upon payment by Mogo of all sums he considered owing to him. On June 28, 1996, an agent of Mogo came to the Livers residence and removed the vehicle. When the garage door was left open momentarily, he entered the vehicle with the aid of a key, backed it out of the garage and drove off. The repossession took place in plain view of Rhonda and her son and over Rhonda's screamed objections. Bernard was inside the house at the time the vehicle was removed. Rhonda's son was upset by the incident. Rhonda herself began to shake and cry uncontrollably and felt emotionally overwhelmed all that day and that night. However, she did not seek or receive any medical attention at the time. Approximately nine months later, she consulted a doctor who diagnosed her as suffering from depression.

The tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad Company run through the city of Kankakee in a northerly and southerly direction, dividing the city into two parts. About 3500 people, or one-fifth of the population, live on the west side of the right of way. At the point where its passenger station stands the right of way occupies the full block between East avenue on its east side and West avenue on its west side. The station is on the east side of the right of way. Merchant street east runs east from the passenger station at right angles to East avenue, and Merchant street west runs west from West avenue at a point opposite the station. Merchant street has never been laid out from East avenue to West avenue. One block north of Merchant street Court street passes over the railroad on a stone viaduct, and one block south of Merchant street Station street crosses the railroad at grade. There are six tracks on the right of way in front of the passenger station. The east track, or the one nearest the passenger station, is the north-bound main, and the track immediately west is the south-bound main. The four tracks west of these mains are switch tracks, used principally for frieght yards. Between the passenger station and the north-bound main is a wide platform. The space from the station platform to the east rail of the south-bound main is planked. These platforms are for the accommodation of passengers going in either direction. For many years people traveling on foot between the parts of the city east and west of the railroad and to whom Merchant street if extended across the railroad would be most convenient, and people in the west part of the city wishing to go to and from the passenger station have been in the habit of going across this right of way over all six tracks when the tracks were not blocked by trains or standing cars. For more than ten years before this accident a cinder path has existed across the right of way from the west side of the platform to the east side of West avenue, practically on the line of what would be the north side of Merchant street if that street had crossed the right of way. The employees of the railroad company placed this cinder path there for their own convenience in conveying ashes from the depot to the west side of the right of way. For several years a large signboard was maintained on the west side of the right of way immediately to the north of Merchant street extended, warning people of the danger and forbidding them to trespass upon the railroad grounds. Deceased, with her parents, lived at Clifton, a village south of Kankakee. They came to Kankakee that afternoon and visited a relative at a hospital which was located in the west part of the city. When they left the hospital they approached the depot from the west. Mr. Bernier turned off Merchant street on an errand, while the deceased and her mother proceeded east on the north side of Merchant street west on their way to the depot to purchase tickets for Clifton. They planned to get their tickets at that time and then go to a moving picture show with Bernier, spending the time there until about ten o'clock, when their train left. Mrs. Bernier and her daughter started across the tracks toward the passenger station on the cinder path. A long freight train, consisting of more than fifty box cars, was then going north on the north-bound main. They crossed the four switch tracks and the south-bound main and were standing close to the east rail of that track waiting for the freight train to pass. The limited passenger train from Chicago to New Orleans was due in Kankakee at 8:05 P.M. and was then approaching the station from the north on the south-bound main. Mrs. Bernier said she looked in both directions for moving trains but saw none, and that she heard no bell or whistle. The freight train was making a very loud, grinding noise, and the smoke of its engine and the curve of the track beyond the viaduct would all tend to prevent the women from seeing or hearing the on-coming passenger train. An eye-witness testified that the passenger train passed under the viaduct, a block north of the women, at a speed of between twenty and thirty miles an hour. The engineer testified that he entered the north city limits going about forty miles an hour; that he gradually slowed down so that he was not going more than fifteen miles an hour when he went under the viaduct and that when he struck the women he was not going more than ten miles an hour. According to his testimony the headlight was burning and the bell was automatically ringing. He said that as he went under the viaduct he saw the women approaching the south-bound main from the west and saw them pass over the east rail of this track. The space between the north-bound and south-bound mains was about ten feet, giving a clearance of more than six feet between the passing trains. He testified that he assumed the women knew of his train and that they expected to step into the zone of safety between the passing trains. He gave them no warning at this time. He raised his eyes from the women and looked at his signal board for his orders and saw that he had a clear board. When he was about seventy-five feet north of the women he glanced down again and saw that they were standing too near the east rail for him to clear them. He sounded the alarm whistle and applied the brakes. The women did not move until the engine struck them. Mrs. Bernier was knocked about thirty feet ahead and deceased about fifty feet, both of them being thrown on the platform between the two mains. The train came to a stop a short distance from the place where the women were struck. After the freight train had passed, depot employees who had been attracted by the alarm whistles picked up the two women. Mrs. Bernier was unconscious and Miss Bernier was dead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "ideal": "Negative"}
